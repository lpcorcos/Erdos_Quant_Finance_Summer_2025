This line segment is of length $\\sqrt{2}$ and the subline segment joining $(0,0)$ to $\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{{2}}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{{2}}\\right)$ has length $1$. Therefore the probability of randomly selectly a point on this line within the subline segment is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Every point on the line segment is of the form $(x,x)$ with $0\\leq x\\leq 1$ and such a point lies within the subline segment of length $1$ if and only if $2x^2 \\leq 1$. We therefore can estimate $\\sqrt{2}$ by selecting $x$ from the unit interval $[0,1]$ with uniform distribution and measure the ratio of $x$-values with the property that $2x^2\\leq 1$. Multiplying the result by $2$ yields an estimate for $\\sqrt{2}$.  "
